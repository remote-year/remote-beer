# Introduction

Welcome to Remote Beer - a Rails application for finding beer while traveling abroad.

The application as it stands today is very simple. There are two models, City and Beer, created with the rails scaffold generator. Our job will be to develop the application as much as possible in 3 hours.

# Constraints

This test is completely open book. You are free to use any tools, resources, libraries, frameworks, tricks, hacks, or knicknacks you choose to employ. I encourage you to use tools that you already know and consult documentation when needed just as you normally would. Do not reinvent the wheel. Below you will find a short list of suggested feature additions. You may choose from this list or you may propose your own features. 

We will be pair programming over a Zoom session. You will be driving the entire time. I do not expect you to complete every suggested feature. This test is open ended. You have 2 hours. You may ask any question you'd like. We must have fun :)

# Evaluation

You are being evaluated on your judgement as a developer. I am looking at how you make tradoffs when tackling particular tasks, the efficiency of your development process, and your familiarity with your preferred tools. 

Things do not need to be production ready at the end of 2 hours. If you cut corners, simply explain your reasoning.

I am not evaluating aesthetics of the front end. It does not need to be pixel perfect.

# Installation

Please fork the git repository and clone to your local machine.

The application comes with a seed file for populating your development database.

`rake db:seed`
